/*		ToDo List:
			**** Import Source files to new multi-project solution - Start compiling components separately
			***	Write comment blocks for each file and class
			***	Revise maze generation logging
			*** Implement Maze Graphing logs
			**	Implement Texture Manager logging
			**	Implement Key Frame animations for 3d Objects
			**	Learn Shader programming and Revisit Shaders
			**	Make Scene Node code easier to read
			*		Implement Basic RPG Stat System
			*		Implement base engine logging
			*		Implement game engine logging
			*		get_exec_path is fixed, reimplement art asset directories
			*		replace input queue (std::vector) with a simple array
			*		Test dynamic text objects and ensure thread safety
			*		Review engine_3d::SetMode methods

//What this project is and has been to me:
/*
		First it should be noted, this is my first real attempt at creating a general purpose engine. With that said this project
		has grown organically along side my knowledge and understanding of OpenGL.

		This project has been a labour of my love to learn. I spent 5 months learning OpenGL from nothing more than a
		pre-existing engine which an Instructor made. I had studied his code and remade much of the functionality he
		had provided, leaving out a few and adding a number of features he did not have. A feature I added was the
		ability to automatically load art assets from directories for example. Once I had recreated all the higher functions of his
		engine I focused on replacing the engine itself. All this while juggling much more stressful and	demanding
		course workloads. The majority of this code base I have created in my spare time, the full working prototype
		was made with a few classes I made through the term and the rest I created during one week of
		my Christmas break.


		It had started out as a team project in second year of college, but after a term of working on it I discovered I was
		the only one who had provided any functional code to our repository for integration with the engine.
		I had been in charge of the engine and all its functions whereas my team was in charge of making dungeon
		crawling gameplay. We had trouble creating a three dimensional representation of a 2d maze. We were unable 
		to complete a stat system.
