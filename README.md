# Status
These projects have long lost dependencies, some may not though. Most of the code these are all based on is essentially the same code, but - potentially - at different points in time and thus probably not compatible. Others, word-search that is, seem to have all code in src/. They all appeared to, for the most part, have binaries that probably work when given access to Assets/ and any required binaries. A few appeared to include the libraries in their repos, so I've kept those but moved them and make no guarantees that they are sufficient for building any of the projects.

## hyper-maze
Probably won't build

## word-search
Looks like it should build, at cursory glance.

## bullet-hell
Might build with the libraries included.

## recursive-path-finder
Might build, but will probably run with any of the four executables. The four executables are different the path finder's different compile time settings, as seen in the code.

## maze-gen
Pretty sure there is no hope of this building, but it probably would not be difficult to remove the dependencies.
